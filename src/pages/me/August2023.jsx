            There are only two things I want to master in my life, coding and
            english language. I think that if i master both of it, I can reach
            my world more wide. I will always develop my website, it means
            improving my code and english skill. If you find a lot of errors in
            this page then find a little one in the next pages, it means i
            improved my skill. Now, let us take a look at my monthly code story.
